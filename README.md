Why Politics Are Like A Fork In The Road - I’ve always found that there’s a reason why politics are like a fork in the road. It’s because you have a choice between two things, and each direction can take you to two different alternatives. Government, political parties, and politicians are familiar with this figurative expression which is why they use it all the time. This is because they want the people to know that they too have been in a similar position once, but with different variations. - https://lowpriceshirt.com/trending/political/
